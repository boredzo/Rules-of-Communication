# Rules of Communication

[Mike Lee's Rule 0](https://twitter.com/bmf/status/379314407479980033): “If you lose your shit, you lose.”

1. Be sincere, not sarcastic or disingenuous. The world has enough insincerity already.
1. Everything is communication. Everything you do is perceived by others, and they will read meaning and intent into it. Choose your actions accordingly.
2. It takes two to tango. If the other party misunderstands you, the chance is *at least* 50% that it was your fault. Don't chew them out; rephrase and clarify.
4. [Assume good faith](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith). Most people want to be right; if you can show them why they're not, they'll switch sides.
3. Be willing to have your mind changed. If the other party shows you why you're wrong, switch sides.
5. People who are entrenched (cannot be convinced by facts and logic) are entrenched for other reasons. Often social; e.g., unwilling to hear arguments against their religion because they would be ostracized from their family if they changed their beliefs, so arguing against their religion is equivalent to arguing that they should leave their family. Don't waste time trying to convince them—you'll only piss them off, even more than yourself.
